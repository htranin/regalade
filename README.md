# Revised Galaxy List for the Advanced Detector Era

We present the REGALADE catalog, a compilation of galaxies with their distances, magnitudes, angular extent and stellar masses, designed to support transient and multi-messenger science. By merging data from key surveys, REGALADE aims to provide a more complete census of galaxies, enabling accurate distance estimates and event matching.

REGALADE combines data from curated galaxy catalogs and imaging surveys, including GLADE, NED Local Volume Survey, Siena Galaxy Atlas, the Legacy Surveys, SDSS, and Pan-STARRS, with additional cross-matching to refine distance measurements.

The REGALADE catalog contains nearly 80 million galaxies in the Local Universe (D < 2000 Mpc). A paper explaining the cqtalog and its contents has been submitted to A&A and is available on arxiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/0000.0000), also showcasing its use through 3 case studies: optical transients, gravitational wave target selection and ultraluminous X-ray sources.
