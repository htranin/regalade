# Revised GAlaxy List for Advanced Detector Era

We present the REGALADE catalog, a compilation of galaxies with their distances, magnitudes and area information, designed to support transient science. By merging data from key surveys, REGALADE aims to provide a more complete census of galaxies, enabling accurate distance estimates and transient matching.

REGALADE combines data from widely used catalogs, including GLADE, NED Local Volume Survey, SDSS, Legacy Survey, and Pan-STARRS, with additional cross-matching to refine distance measurements.

The REGALADE catalog contains over 36 million galaxies in the Local Universe (D < 2 Gpc). A paper is in preparation to showcase its use through 2 case studies: optical transients and ultraluminous X-ray sources.
